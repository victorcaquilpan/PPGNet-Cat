# PPGNet-Cat

<p align="justify"> This is a Re-ID model able to identify feral cats in the wild. It was built based on [PPGNET](https://github.com/LcenArthas/CVWC2019-Amur-Tiger-Re-ID/tree/master), which was utilised in the identification of Amur tigers (Siberian tigers). Feral cats make a devastating impact in the Wildlife in Australia as well as around the world. Their identification is mostly done using camera traps in different locations and context, however, the individual identification is a tedious and extensive work, where ecologist try to recognize specific marks to discriminate and monitor a specific individual. This model seeks to contribute with the identfication of these animals, supporting monitoring and tracking tasks. </p>
